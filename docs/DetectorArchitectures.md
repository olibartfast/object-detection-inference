## YOLO Family

YOLO (‚ÄúYou Only Look Once‚Äù) is a family of single-stage detectors optimized for speed. Predictions are made densely over feature maps, producing bounding boxes and classes in one forward pass.

### Architecture and Core Idea

- Early YOLO (v1‚Äìv2)
  - Grid-based predictions (S√óS cells); each cell predicts a fixed number of boxes, objectness, and class probabilities.
  - v2 introduces anchors (dimension clustering), BN, and a stronger backbone.

- Modern YOLO (v3+)
  - Dense predictions on multi-scale feature maps (FPN/PAN-like necks).
  - Anchor-based heads (v2‚Äìv7) ‚Üí anchor-free heads (v8+).
  - Decoupled heads for classification vs box regression are common (v6+).
  - Inference typically uses NMS; YOLOv10 is NMS-free by design.

## RT-DETR Family

RT-DETR combines efficient CNN backbones with transformer encoders/decoders to achieve real-time, end-to-end detection without NMS.

### Core Concept

- CNN backbone for efficient feature extraction.

### Architecture Components

1. Backbone: ResNet-like or other efficient CNN for multi-scale features.
2. Encoder: Multi-scale transformer encoder to aggregate global context.
3. Decoder: Transformer decoder with learnable queries producing object slots.
4. Prediction Heads: Boxes (e.g., L1/GIoU) and classes (CE/Focal), trained end-to-end.

### Training and Inference Notes

- Matching: Hungarian matching aligns predictions with ground truth (set prediction).
- Auxiliary losses on intermediate decoder layers help convergence.
- NMS-free by design; some repos expose optional NMS for convenience/compatibility.

Scale key: T = Tiny, S = Small, M = Medium, L = Large, XL = Extra Large.  
Notes:
- Categories are relative and resolution-dependent. Doubling input width/height roughly quadruples FLOPs and increases memory accordingly.
- Availability of exact scale names varies by repo (e.g., n/s/m/l/x for Ultralytics); mapping here is conceptual.

  - YOLO families and YOLO-NAS: strong support for ONNX, TensorRT, and various runtimes (e.g., OpenVINO, CoreML) depending on repo/tools.
  - RT-DETR: exportability improving; NMS-free simplifies deployment graphs, but attention blocks may need optimized kernels.

- Quantization
  - YOLO-NAS: QAT-ready by design; good fit for INT8 on edge.
  - YOLO (v8/YOLO11): widely used with post-training quantization or QAT via vendor toolchains.

- NMS-free benefits
  - Eliminates post-processing latency and threshold sensitivity (e.g., YOLOv10, RT-DETR).
  - Can simplify end-to-end pipelines and make latency more predictable.
